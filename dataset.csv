"I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazedâ€”and gazedâ€”but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils. ",Nature
"I thought of you so much today
I went to God in prayer.
To ask Him to watch over you
and show you that I care.

My prayer for you was not for rewards
ones that you can touch or feel.
But true rewards for happiness
that are so very real.",Religion
"The harp at Nature's advent strung
Has never ceased to play;
The song the stars of morning sung
Has never died away.

And prayer is made, and praise is given,
By all things near and far;
The ocean looketh up to heaven,
And mirrors every star.

Its waves are kneeling on the strand,
As kneels the human knee,
Their white locks bowing to the sand,
The priesthood of the sea!

They pour their glittering treasures forth,
Their gifts of pearl they bring,
And all the listening hills of earth
Take up the song they sing.

The green earth sends its incense up
From many a mountain shrine;
From folded leaf and dewy cup
She pours her sacred wine.

The mists above the morning rills
Rise white as wings of prayer;
The altar-curtains of the hills
Are sunset's purple air.

The winds with hymns of praise are loud,
Or low with sobs of pain, --
The thunder-organ of the cloud,
The dropping tears of rain.",Nature

"Near the path through the woods I’ve seen it:
a trail of white candles.

I could find it again, I could follow
its light deep into shadows.

Didn’t I stand there once? 
Didn’t I choose to go back

down the cleared path, the familiar?
Narcissus, you said. Wasn’t this

the flower whose sudden enchantments
led Persephone down into Hades?

You remember the way she was changed
when she came every spring, having seen

the withering branches, the chasms,
and how she had to return there

helplessly, having eaten
the seed of desire. What was it

I saw you were offering me
without meaning to, there in the sunlight,

while the flowers beckoned and shone
in their flickering season?",Mythology
"When you come to me, unbidden,
Beckoning me

Trunks of secret words,

I CRY.",Love

"Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.

"Cythera saw Adonis
And knew that he was dead;
She marked the brow, all grisly now,
The cheek no longer red;
And ""Bring the boar before me""
Unto her Loves she said.
 
Forthwith her winged attendants
Ranged all the woodland o'er,
And found and bound in fetters
Threefold the grisly boar:
One dragged him at a rope's end
E'en as a vanquished foe;
One went behind and drave him
And smote him with his bow:
On paced the creature feebly;
He feared Cythera so.
 
To him said Aphrodite:
""So, worst of beasts, 'twas you
Who rent that thigh asunder,
Who him that loved me slew?""
And thus the beast made answer:
""Cythera, hear me swear
By thee, by him that loved thee,
And by these bonds I wear,
And them before whose hounds I ran--
I meant no mischief to the man
Who seemed to thee so fair.",Mythology

That is going on in the sky
Right now

"What forest is there to run to,
other than the one within another’s heart?

What appears to be deeply rooted 
is half dead         drowning

I hate to say this 
but what is stable
can be easily disrupted,
and what is easily disrupted
can cloud       even        the clearest of days.

This is what I have come to know 
after being turned on,
             turned over,

I want to spark the heat of this body with the heart, with 
the heart of the heart, with the heart of the heart of this

slow it down and tinker with it. I want to slow it all the way 
downdowndown to a gentle timber,or fall.

"I, at Eleusis, saw the finest sight,
When early morning's banners were unfurled.
From high Olumpus, gazing on the world,
The ancient gods once saw it with delight.
Sad Demeter had in a single night
Removed her sombre garments! and mine eyes
Beheld a 'broidered mantle in pale dyes
Thrown o'er her throbbing bosom. Sweet and clear
There fell the sound of music on mine ear.
And from the South came Hermes, he whose lyre
One time appeased the great Apollo's ire.
The rescued maid, Persephone, by the hand,
He led to waiting Demeter, and cheer
And light and beauty once more blessed the land. ",Mythology

with the word confidante. The birches
 
are hilled, coming toward you, going away,

"I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Laughed loud at her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went laughing at her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee",Love

    A murmur of the rain;
And they knew that Earth was longing

"In Artemisia Gentileschi’s painting of Cleopatra, Cleopatra reclines, heavy-lidded, left hand limp on the pillow above her head. In her right hand, she clutches an asp. Is this the moment before she is bitten or just after? I want to know whether, at the moment of death, that first release will stiffen. In Danaë, her reclining figure echoes Cleopatra’s but Danaë’s left hand is limp with leisure, not surrender, while her right holds a fistful of the gold coins raining down on her naked thighs. Looking at this painting now, I don’t feel leisure. I don’t feel sex. I feel that I might stiffen and not be able to rise. Danaë’s legs crossed at the calves and pressing against the bed cause her back to arch so that the moment of her desire mirrors Cleopatra’s death. The figure retains energy, a tension that defies either weariness or leisure. I like to work from the people that I see and that I want to see. What is fabric to skin, skin to violence? Sometimes I’m concerned with using something that’s in them and which isn’t actually visible. I try to capture the figure where the sun has darkened the skin. But that isn’t the end of the neck. In Judith Slaying Holofernes, the light hits Judith’s neck only at the base.",Mythology

Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart

When there is only one Holy Bible for all to read
There is one church over here and one over there

the beetles, quiet, somnolent, darkly, fell and again fell
like plums. Once woken, they bzzzed towards

against them until they landed face down or face
up, trying to find their feet, reminding me of Eve’s face
as a baby when she tried to lift her head on her stem
of a neck before yet she could. Upon the child’s shoulders,
beetles landed, kinging him. The dusk’s gray mute
unfolded its scrolls, while his mother made toast
with boysenberry jam, his father played solitaire,
and think of his sister doing her biology homework.
But they are under the tree, he is, the bright ones falling
upon him like stars, and as they fall, he names them:
some doctors, some cooks, depending on the size
of their antennae. His face was a diary of leaves: dark,

Love for poor in wretchedness,
Love that speaks of blessedness.

Hope by Christ the Saviour given,
Hope that we through Him may rise
To the realms above the skies.

"Do you remember Sita? How when Hanuman came to rescue her
she refused, how she insisted that Rama come openly,
defeat her captor Ravana openly? She had no desire for stealth,
no desire for intrigue, and though Ravana could not touch her
for the curse on his flesh, she remained captive until Rama came.
Do you remember that she was tortured? That Hunaman asked her
for permission to kill the women who had tortured her? Do you
remember how she walked through fire to prove her purity,
even though everyone knew of the curse on Ravana? How the people
said the fire didn’t matter because Fire was the brother of her mother,
Earth? How Rama was as weak in the face of his people as he
had been strong in the face of Ravana? Can you imagine the eyes
of Sita when she refused another test? When she looked at Rama,
a man she loved enough to die for, a man who was a god, and knew
it was over? Can you imagine her eyes in that moment, as she asked
her mother to take her back, to swallow her back into the earth? I think
my eyes are like that now, leaving you.",Mythology

"LOVE IS
Always good mannered, bears up under stress
Looks for ways to be kindly, is quick to confess.

LOVE IS NOT
Ever possessive, nor needs to impress.
Not touchy, nor jealous if it seems to get less.

LOVE IS
Looking to share, and hopes for good things.
Knows no limits to taking what life sometimes brings

LOVE IS NOT
Proud or boastful, it does not feel revoked
By injuries suffered, nor is it provoked.

LOVE IS
Decent, believing, looking for good.
Contented, yet happy when misunderstood.
It's trusting, and hoping, as love always should.
Thus love begets love. It personifies God.

Lets hold up the feelings we deem to call Love.
Comparing them close in the light of above",Love

We think Marsyas is the only one
who changed, stepping forth
from the forest to challenge Apollo, staring at the god

he could never rival as if
into a harshly lit mirror, each recoiling

at what he found there: the jealousy knifed
inside the mortal talent, the cold perfection
threaded through with rage.

But then the muses stirred behind them.
And Marsyas, out the painful human wish
to be admired, cannot help but play.

And afterwards, the cutting,
the stripped corpuscles, the ruined mouth—

     Only after his victory would Apollo reach out
and clip three small muscles from the satyr’s throat
and shoulders, and dry them on a rock, and string them between
the curved horns of his lyre. Then the god

would pull a song
through that tender sinew, telling himself

it was not the crying of one
who’s lost everything he loves but the god’s
own singing that he heard, and after which
the muses strained, because it was the song

of someone who knew what it was like
to be alive, which the god could not bear
to know, or to stop playing.

And so Apollo, unthinking, binds himself
to Marsyas: the god taking from his rival

fear and desire, the satyr hardened by the god’s
cruel skill, until both songs

writhe inside each other, sung

never understands what he plays,

Of turning around my terrible day.
She makes all the bad things go away
The second that she says hey.

And when I look into her eyes,
I see pure beauty with no disguise.
Just a glance at her makes my heartbeat rise.
I know for a fact that these feelings aren't lies.

If only she knew
How much my love for her grew,
Maybe, just maybe, we could start something new,
And then I'd never feel blue.

And if beauty were inches, she'd go on for miles.
I'd better catch her before I go out of style.
I'm going to let my heart be my dial
So I can tell her what I've been feeling for a while.

"Since there’s no help, come let us kiss and part;
Nay, I have done, you get no more of me,
And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart
That thus so cleanly I myself can free;
Shake hands forever, cancel all our vows,
And when we meet at any time again,
Be it not seen in either of our brows
That we one jot of former love retain.
Now at the last gasp of Love’s latest breath,
When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies,
When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death,
And Innocence is closing up his eyes,

From death to life thou mightst him yet recover.",Love

Which was my sin, though it were done before?
Wilt thou forgive that sin, through which I run,
And do run still, though still I do deplore?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
For I have more.

Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won
Others to sin, and made my sin their door?
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun
A year or two, but wallowâ€™d in, a score?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
For I have more.

I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun
My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
But swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son
Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore;

Heard neither warbling of the nightingale,
Nor melody of the Lybian lotus flute
Blown seaward from the shore; but from a slope

Beneath a highland leaning down a weight
Of cliffs, and zoned below with cedar shade,

To fasten friends and feed them at thy will
With form and favour, taught me to believe
How thou art made to show her greatest skill,
Whose hidden virtues are not so unknown

Where beauty so her perfect seed hath sown
Of other graces follow needs there must.

Up from the tangle of withered weeds

Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,

To walk, and pass our long love’s day.

Of Humber would complain. I would
Love you ten years before the flood,
And you should, if you please, refuse
Till the conversion of the Jews.

Vaster than empires and more slow;
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;

others flew beheaded. But at first when we looked at them, we could
see no difference, the way it can take a while to realize about how
regretfulness is not regret. As for being frightened: though for many
animals the governing instinct, when most afraid, is to attack, what about
the tendency of songbirds, in a storm, toward silence—is that fear, too?
For mostly, yes, we were silent—tired, as well, though as much out of
boredom as for the need to stretch a bit, why not the rest on foot, we

And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated,

That had me by the coat as good as seated,
And since there was no other way to look,
Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue,
Stood over me a resurrected tree,
A tree that had been down and raised again—
A barkless spectre. He had halted too,
As if for fear of treading upon me.
I saw the strange position of his hands—
Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands
Of wire with something in it from men to men.

And what’s the news you carry—if you know?
And tell me where you’re off for—Montreal?

I made a garland for her head,
       And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
       And made sweet moan

I set her on my pacing steed,

For sidelong would she bend, and sing
       A faery’s song.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
       And honey wild, and manna-dew,
And sure in language strange she said—
       ‘I love thee true’.

She took me to her Elfin grot,
       And there she wept and sighed full sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
       With kisses four.

And there she lullèd me asleep,
       And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever dreamt
       On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
       Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
       Thee hath in thrall!’

I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
       With horrid warning gapèd wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
       On the cold hill’s side.

And this is why I sojourn here,
       Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,

              An island off the southernmost tip of Peru.

while paying the bills
              Guess I’ll have to give up that whole new career plan.
              Academic dreams. House-and-yard dreams.

From my hair;
And wrenched the bronze sandals
From my ankles.

Who knew the holy wisdom of poets,
Who had drunk at the feast
Where Simonides sang.

In the white mist of olives;
No more do I take the rose-crown
From the white hands of a maiden.

Of the minutest cricket,

As will suffice tolight her lamps,

With infinite affection
An infiniter care,
Her golden finger on her lip,
Wills silence everywhere.

"When we are old and these rejoicing veins
Are frosty channels to a muted stream,
And out of all our burning their remains
No feeblest spark to fire us, even in dream,
This be our solace: that it was not said
When we were young and warm and in our prime,
Upon our couch we lay as lie the dead,
Sleeping away the unreturning time.
O sweet, O heavy-lidded, O my love,
When morning strikes her spear upon the land,
And we must rise and arm us and reprove
The insolent daylight with a steady hand,
Be not discountenanced if the knowing know
We rose from rapture but an hour ago.

"At the bottom of my garden
There's a hedgehog and a frog
And a lot of creepy-crawlies
Living underneath a log,
There's a baby daddy long legs
And an easy-going snail
And a family of woodlice,
All are on my nature trail.

There are caterpillars waiting
For their time to come to fly,
There are worms turning the earth over
As ladybirds fly by,
Birds will visit, cats will visit
But they always chose their time
And I've even seen a fox visit
This wild garden of mine.

Squirrels come to nick my nuts
And busy bees come buzzing
And when the night time comes
Sometimes some dragonflies come humming,
My garden mice are very shy
And I've seen bats that growl
And in my garden I have seen
A very wise old owl.

My garden is a lively place
There's always something happening,
There's this constant search for food
And then there's all that flowering,
When you have a garden
You will never be alone
And I believe we all deserve
A garden of our own. ",Nature
"The owner smiles as if she knows me
and pulls out a chair. Beside the doorway
a copper basin lies on its side. Nana Ross had one
just like it, in the kitchen, behind the grocery shop.

As a child I imagined my soul was that color
and sanctifying grace was red, dripping
rosary-like, a kind of divine sweat that smelt
of frankincense, myrrh, milk and straw.

By age nine I had committed a mortal sin,
let Nicki Walshe touch me there and didnâ€™t tell,
made a bad confession, took communion
paper thin and white on my black-spotted tongue.

Nana sprinkled us with holy water,
gave me a blessed rosary from Lourdes,
all blue and purple it was, but I lost it
like I lost the library book, sins mounting up;

the row over contraception with a priest
in the confessional box in Stillorgan.
Sister Anne, white musty face, those thin lips
â€œHow dare you, a girl, question holy men.â€

Lying bare-breasted in the long grass with CiarÃ¡n,
drinking Guinness followed by Harvey Wallbangers,
vomiting it all up on Pearse Street,
a guy from Tuam holding my forehead.

Walking away from my fatherâ€™s house, my marriage,
my job, to dance barefoot in a circle of women
who prayed with wrists, hips, feet and drums,
bellies painted gold, Magdalene red.

"I knew exactly what Love looked like … in 7th grade.

Even though I hadn’t met Love yet, if Love had wandered into my home room I would have recognized him at first glance – Love wore a hemp necklace.
I would have recognized her at first glance – Love wore a tight French braid.
Love played acoustic guitar, and knew all my favorite Beatles’ songs.
Love wasn’t afraid to ride the bus with me.
And I knew I just must be searching the wrong class room, just must be checking the wrong hallway.
She was there, I was sure of it.
If only I could find him.

But when Love finally showed up – she had a bull cut!
He wore the same clothes everyday for a week.
Love hated the bus.
Love didn’t know anything about the Beatles.

Instead, every time I tried to kiss Love, our teeth got in the way!!!

Love became the reason I lied to my parents. I’m going to Ben’s house.
Love had terrible rhythm on the dance floor but made sure we never miss a slow song.
Love waited by the phone because she knew if her father picked up that’d be “Hello”… “Hh..” “Hello?” “Hh…” “I guess I’d hang up.”

And Love grew.
Stretched like a trampoline.

Love changed.
Love disappeared, slowly, like baby teeth.
Loosing parts of me I thought I needed.

Love vanished.
Like an amateur magician everyone could see the trapdoor but me.
Like a flat tire – there were other places I had planned on going.
But my plan didn’t matter.

Love stayed away for years.
And when Love finally reappeared, I barely recognized him.

Love smells different now, had darker eyes.
A broader back, Love came with freckles that I didn’t recognize.
New birth mark – a softer voice.
Now there were new sleeping patterns.
New favorite books.
Love had songs that reminded him of someone else.
Songs Love didn’t like to listen to, so did I.

But we found a park bench that fit us perfectly.
We found jokes that make us laugh.
And now Love makes me fresh homemade chocolate chip cookies.
(But Love will probably finish most of them for a midnight snack.)

Love looks great in lingerie but still likes to wear her retainer.
Love is a terrible driver, but a great navigator.
Love knows where she’s going, it just might take her two hours longer than she planned.
Love is messier now.
Love is simple.
Love uses the word boobs in front of my parents!
Love chews too loud.
Love leaves the cap off the toothpaste.
Love uses a smiley face in her text messages.
And turns out… Love shits.

But Love also cries;
And Love will tell you “You are beautiful”, and mean it.
Over and over again.

“You are beautiful.”

When you first wake up, “You are beautiful.”
When you’ve just been crying, “You are beautiful.”
When you don’t wanna hear it, “You are beautiful.”
When you don’t believe it, “You are beautiful.”
When nobody else will tell you, “You are beautiful.”
Love still thinks, “You are beautiful.”
But Love is not perfect and will sometimes forget.
When you need to hear it most, “You are beautiful.”

Do not forget this.
Love is not who you were expecting.
Love is not what you can predict.
Maybe Love is in New York City already asleep.
You are in California, Australia, wide awake.
Maybe Love is always in the wrong time-zone.
Maybe Love is not ready for you.
Maybe you are not ready for Love.

Maybe Love just isn’t the marrying type.
Maybe the next time you see Love is 20 years after the divorce.
Love looks older now but just as beautiful as you remember.
Maybe Love is only there for a month.
Maybe Love is there for every firework. Every birthday party. Every hospital visit.
Maybe Love stays. Maybe Love can’t. Maybe Love shouldn’t.

Love arrives exactly when Love is supposed to and Love leaves exactly when Love must.
When Love arrives, say, “Welcome. Make yourself comfortable.”
If Love leaves, ask her to leave the door open behind her.
Turn off the music. Listen to the quiet.
Whisper, “Thank you for stopping by.”",Love
"By way of my mother, the deacon with the slick gray hair and money
clip in his pocket can claim a percentage of my body like tithe rights.
And on this Sunday, as with every other Sunday, he is a slender
ebony panel in the fence of faith, one man in the company of men
standing shoulder to shoulder in suits, tapping their toes, clapping
their hands, putting muscle to work in the making of praise music.
We Baptists call this devotion, my working definition of which
is faithfulness to the light. To the extent that God is as white
as the clouds of heaven, this theory holds. To the extent these
particular men are dark, I must consider other possibilities:
that God remade himself in my image so that we could be closer
or that devotion means the commitment of black men to stand
with one another, form a barricade of soldiers against anything
as necessary, the Lord being the force holding them fast in line.
It isnâ€™t always easy for me to see these explanations as separate:
any film, any photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. leading a march,
with his position centered in a line of bodies covering the entire width
of the frameâ€‰â€”â€‰if I take a wide view of that scene, I see the Lord at
work. Ifâ€Š I zoom in, on a single person or the breach between two, I see
no trace of the Lord at all, a hint that He canâ€™t exist in small spaces.
                                                                  And whatâ€™s more, consider this:
say Chicago PD pulls a long line of youths into the precinct for
photographsâ€‰â€”â€‰all of them dark, all of them wearing the same colorsâ€‰â€”â€‰
and stands them shoulder to shoulder. Zoom in: nothing. Zoom out:
the Lord? Why not? Thereâ€™s clearly commitment there, devotion.
Theyâ€™re all definitely soldiers, on the battlefield for something:
maybe itâ€™s white, maybe itâ€™s green, maybe itâ€™s a colorless
feeling. Iâ€™ve got no good answers, only darkness. Iâ€™m still trying
to decipher if it means anything that Dr. King lived in Vice
Lords territory when he spent â€™66 in Chicago, that the words
â€œviceâ€ and â€œLordâ€ are affiliates, homeboys, next-door neighbors.
I think about their coming up together in the mind of a boy
living on that side of town, a percentage of his body, perhaps,
claimed as a tax; I canâ€™t shake this feeling that when he throws his
muscles into praise music, when sound leaves his precious mouth,
people scatter. I canâ€™t help but believe our songs, to one another,
would be familiar, church family:

                                                      I am on the battlefield for my Lord

                           and I promised Him that I
                                          would serve Him till I die
                                                      till I die, till I die, till I die",Religion

"As a fond mother, when the day is o'er,
Leads by the hand her little child to bed,
Half willing, half reluctant to be led,
And leave his broken playthings on the floor,
Still gazing at them through the open door,
Nor wholly reassured and comforted
By promises of others in their stead,
Which though more splendid, may not please him more;
So Nature deals with us, and takes away
Our playthings one by one, and by the hand
Leads us to rest so gently, that we go
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,
Being too full of sleep to understand
How far the unknown transcends the what we know. ",Nature

That, for all they care, I can go to hell,

If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.

Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn,

I would not change for thine.

I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much hon’ring thee As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be;

And sent’st it back to me,
Since when it grows and smells, I swear
Not of itself, but thee.",Love

Light gleams from brass and steel—

End it in mist-pale sleep!",Nature

they called it Adam

  An ambling palfrey white—a golden robe and crown:

  And heard the ogre laugh—as she fell into his snare,
  At the little tender creature—who wept and tore her hair!

"How many times we say or do
Something that we thought was true
And then it made us sad;
A hurtful word, a shameful look
I've done enough to write a book -
I doubt that it would sell;
We stumble on in ignorance
Until in time we find by chance
The answers that we seek,
For there are lessons to be learned

Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

Live o’er again that happy hour,
When midway on the mount I lay,

Amid the lingering light.

Praise his son, silvered, and then was gone,

His long strides causing him to blend, light-bent,

Into the shining, maize meadow cloudbank						

Shadowed by that one solitary tree 

It takes sixteen years for light, let alone

A soul, to cross.

Though they had died, rejoiced at seeing me

And sang, one by one, to me; and I in 

Turn said back to one after the other

That the song that soul sang was a blessing

And that I had never heard anything

Like it; which was true, but also, I must

Admit, they bored me to tears, tears that their

Surprisingly still finite knowledge took

As tears of pure joy from hearing them sing.

Kept away, arms crossed, refusing to speak,

Dim-starred and disappearing into his rage.

All because of a simple spar of words,

A mere speech, and winning Achilles’ armor.

Decided that, not me, although it’s true 

He never stood chance. But by custom

Should have been given the matchless metal. 

How I wish I hadn’t won that contest.

How the ground closed over his head for it.

No equal in action but for the one

Man who surpassed him, just-fled Achilles,

So capable of happiness despite

All that happened because he washed up here,

towed the drowned, wing-wrecked bird
through a slick of his own feathery want,

from knowing, and the falling distance
made the surface turn hard to his body.

winged himself, had to watch fishermen
circle his son, like figures in a painting,
pondering as if there were meaning in water.

and wash ashore, prodding their bodies
with toe, stick, a disbelieving finger?

I found a hummingbird against the curb,
marveled at the glasswork of its stillness,
how the light was falling too, so I could

the ants will carry away. I can’t say
if it died from wanting too much
or from finding what it wanted too much.
Surely, Icarus had the heart of a hummingbird.
If they revived him, would he have risen
back into the sky, damaged wiser,
or, bratty, simply blamed his crap wings?
I nudged the bird with my shoe, not expecting,
but half wishing, a startling burst

fleeing Nineveh.
Who wants to hear what is evil?
Every day we make this earth less

I should go to Nineveh
and cry against wickedness

in an ex-county hall.
Mops in corridors, half-empty

They took photos of us
pretending to look scared
in front of green screens.

gilled glide,
ravenous for outside.
We were vomited onto dry land

It is dominion.

God: father, son, and holy spirit, nÃ©e ghost. Then I started writing
JMJ on all my homework and tests, for good luck, but also because

My ballpointâ€™s blue ink looked pretty beside the paperâ€™s purple
Ink, like the inside of a clamshell when I teared up or squinted
From the smell. Sometimes the sheets were wet and curled like

Petals reeking of gin, which is why it was called spirit duplication,
After the nonflammable alcohol used in the process. Jesus, Mary,
And Joseph, is what the three initials meant. Iâ€™d draw a cross from

The descending caret of the M and think of Mary, the mother,
And of the other Mary, not, weeping at the limp feet of the crucified
Jesus. Where was Joseph, I wondered, but never asked. We seemed

To pity him a little, for reasons I couldnâ€™t name, like my father,
Who was both my father and a son, and soon to be the son of
His fatherâ€™s ghost. When my grandmother was dying, she asked

Her only child, my mother, to go with her. Mom waited decades
To obey, but she finally went. Together in one grave now, they are
Two Marys, maybe with the Jesus of their most solitary prayers,

Like being childless, is both good and bad, I think,

Dropping from lazy fingers
Quiet coloured hours,
Fluttering away from me
Like oak and beech leaves in October.

I have lived keenly and wastefully,
Like a bush or a sun insect—
Lived sensually and thoughtfully,
Loving the flesh and the beauty of this world—
Green ivy about ruined towers,
The out-pouring of the grey sea,
And the ecstasy
Of a pale clear sky at sunset.

I have been prodigal of love
For cities and for lonely places;
I have tried not to hate mankind;
I have gathered sensations
Like ripe fruits in a rich orchard…
All this is gone;
There are no leaves, no sea,
No shade of a rich orchard,
Only a sterile, dusty waste,
Empty and threatening.

We know ourselves to be part of mystery.
It is unspeakable.
It is everlasting.
It is for keeps.",Love
"of November. It strips off the rest
of the leaves, reminds trees
how to shiver. I think to Earth
it looks like the first first rain, the water
of the beginning, swirling down hot
into gassy soup. The bubbling stuff
that imagined trees to begin with, and also
mountains, kangaroos, dolphin cartilage,
stoplights. And you, tearing down
hills on Arnold street, a blur
of training wheels and streamers. And me
in the ’80s, crunching Life cereal on the couch
beside my night-owl mother, blue in the light
of David Letterman’s grin.

Try to remember, everything that is solid
is not solid. But slowly, always melting. The road
cracks, wrinkles like a folded map. Huge trees
lie down, throb into pulp inside termites.
And the ground drinks you,
though you grow, a tall drink of water,
going down easy. It swallows me faster
and faster. But don’t worry. Look at
our neighbor’s roof—those fake gray shingles
are crumbling, growing a thick pelt
of moss. Eventually
we all wake up as forest.",Nature
